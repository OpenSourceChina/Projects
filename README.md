## 1. Objective-C

###a. [VVDocumenter-Xcode](https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode) by [onevcat](https://github.com/onevcat)

Writing document is so important for developing, but it is really painful with Xcode. Think about how much time you are wasting in pressing '*' or '/', and typing the parameters again and again. Now, you can find the method (or any code) you want to document to, and type in `///`, the document will be generated for you and all params and return will be extracted into a beatiful Javadoc style. You can just fill the inline placeholders to finish your document。

Here is an image which can show what it exactly does.
